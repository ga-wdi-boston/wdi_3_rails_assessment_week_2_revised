### Question 1

#### Answer:
<code>rails new BunnyApp --database=postgresql -T</code>


### Question 2

I want to create a new model called `Bunny`, with the following attributes: name (string), color (string), and age (integer). What command(s) should I type in the terminal and/or Sublime? (In your answer, create both a migration and the model file.)

#### Answer:
<code>$ rails g migration Bunny</code>
<p>
  <pre><code>class CreateBunnies &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      create_table bunnies do |t|
        t.string :name, null: false
        t.string :color
        t.integer :age

        t.timestamps
      end
    end
  end</code></pre>
</p>

#### Updates:
—————————————————————————————————————
I didn't create a model file!!! :-(
I would create a new file "bunny.rb"
<p>
<pre>
<code>class Bunny &lt; ActiveRecord
end</code>
</pre>
</p>

### Question 3
What does the command in Question 2 do, exactly? What files are created, where are they located, and what does the database look like at this time? Explain.

#### Answer:
<code>$ rails g migration Bunny</code> creates an empty migration file in your db directory of the rails app. 
<br>
<p>
  <pre><code>class CreateBunnies &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table bunnies do |t|
      t.string :name, null: false
      t.string :color
      t.integer :age

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end</code></pre>
</p>

* this file defines the columns of your table Bunnies with 3 declared datatypes: name (string), color (string), age (integer)

#### Updates:
